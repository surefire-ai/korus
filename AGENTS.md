## Project Identity

Korus is an enterprise Agent Control Plane built on Kubernetes.

Treat this project as a four-component system, not as a generic app or a
prompt playground:

- The **operator/control plane** lives in `api/`, `internal/controller/`,
  `internal/compiler/`, `internal/gateway/`, and `internal/runtime/`.
- The future **manager** is an optional database-backed product backend used by
  the Web Console for tenants, workspaces, users, teams, releases, durable
  audits, and UI drafts.
- The **execution plane** lives in `cmd/worker/` and `internal/worker/`.
- The **runner** boundary lives behind the worker and is where Eino and future
  execution engines belong.
- The declarative API surface is defined by Kubernetes CRDs under
  `api/v1alpha1/` and generated manifests under `config/crd/bases/`.

Current repository direction:

- Default runtime direction is `runtime.engine=eino` with
  `runtime.runnerClass=adk`.
- `Skill` is a reusable capability bundle.
- `Pattern` is a compile-time convenience layer.
- `react` is the first supported pattern preset.
- Do **not** introduce a separate `rag` preset. ReAct should consume the
  agent's normal `knowledgeRefs` and `toolRefs`.
- Product direction is explicitly **enterprise, multi-tenant, evaluation-led,
  and UX-aware**.
- The future console is a **first-class visual orchestration, evaluation, and
  release surface**, not a thin dashboard layered on top of CRDs.
- Product tenant/workspace state belongs in the future manager database.
  Kubernetes `Tenant` and `Workspace` resources are lightweight runtime-scope
  bridge resources, not the canonical enterprise product database.

## What To Optimize For

When making changes, optimize for these goals in order:

1. Preserve clean boundaries between operator, manager, worker, and runner.
2. Keep CRDs and compiled artifacts deterministic and auditable.
3. Make the product shape enterprise-ready: tenancy, isolation, governance,
   provider breadth, and evaluation are not optional extras.
4. Treat the web console as a product surface for visual orchestration,
   evaluation, release, and collaboration, not as a passive admin view.
5. Prefer incremental extension of the existing model over broad redesign.
6. Keep the worker runtime simple enough to validate locally in Kubernetes.
7. Make changes that support the current roadmap:
   `Skill -> Pattern -> Runtime semantics -> SubAgent/A2A`.

## Build, Buy, Integrate Policy

Use this rule of thumb when deciding whether to implement something here.

### Build in this repository

These are the core differentiators and should stay first-class:

- CRD API shape
- compiler rules and validation
- deterministic compiled artifacts
- `AgentRun` lifecycle and status contract
- evaluation contract, revision comparison, and release-gate semantics
- provider abstraction and capability modeling
- tenant and workspace runtime-scope references in the control-plane model
- manager-to-operator synchronization contracts
- Kubernetes runtime dispatch and secret-handling boundaries
- opinionated `Skill` and `Pattern` behavior

### Borrow ideas from other projects

These areas are worth studying and adapting, but not necessarily copying:

- tenancy and namespace strategy
- package and marketplace models
- SubAgent composition
- A2A-compatible resource boundaries
- enterprise evaluation UX and workflow patterns
- provider catalog and model-switching UX
- product-facing console and platform workflows
- manager database schema and enterprise product workflows

### Integrate instead of rewrite

Do not rebuild these unless the user explicitly asks for it and there is a
clear project-specific reason:

- model provider integrations below the control-plane contract
- graph execution engines
- vector databases and retrieval infrastructure
- object storage and queue infrastructure
- tracing, metrics, and logging foundations
- generic UI infrastructure

The project should own the **API, compiler, and runtime contract**, not every
implementation detail beneath them.

## Architectural Guardrails

### 1. Do not collapse controller and worker responsibilities

Keep these responsibilities separate:

- `controller-manager` reconciles resources, compiles artifacts, manages status,
  and dispatches runs.
- `manager` stores product state in a database and syncs runtime resources to
  Kubernetes when running in managed enterprise mode.
- `worker` consumes compiled artifacts and run input, then executes models,
  tools, retrieval, and future graph semantics.
- `runner` implementations execute agent semantics behind the worker boundary.

Do not move execution logic into controllers just because it seems convenient.
Do not move product database concerns such as membership, UI drafts, billing,
or durable audits into CRDs just because they are related to runtime scope.

### 2. CRDs are the operator surface

If you add new behavior, prefer expressing it through:

- typed API fields in `api/v1alpha1/`
- compiled artifact data in `internal/compiler/`
- runtime interpretation in `internal/worker/`

Avoid hidden behavior that only exists in worker code without an API or
artifact representation.

For enterprise product state, prefer manager-owned database models and a clear
manager-to-operator sync contract. Do not turn CRDs into the primary store for
users, teams, memberships, UI drafts, billing, or long-lived audit history.

### 3. Compiler first, runtime second

For new orchestration features:

1. add or refine API shape
2. validate references and ambiguity in the compiler
3. encode the behavior into compiled artifacts
4. only then interpret it in the worker/runtime

This is especially important for:

- `Skill`
- `Pattern`
- future `SubAgent`
- future A2A interoperability

### 4. Prefer one obvious path

Do not add parallel abstractions unless there is a strong reason.

Examples:

- Do not add a separate `rag` preset; make `react` consume `knowledgeRefs`.
- Do not create a second skill system outside `Skill` CRDs.
- Do not create a second runtime contract outside compiled artifacts and
  `AgentRun`.

## Current Implementation Truths

These are current facts of the repo and should be preserved unless the user
explicitly asks for a directional change:

- `Agent`, `AgentRun`, `Tenant`, `Workspace`, `PromptTemplate`,
  `ToolProvider`, `KnowledgeBase`, `Dataset`, `MCPServer`, `AgentPolicy`,
  `AgentEvaluation`, and `Skill` are CRD-backed resources.
- The product target is an enterprise multi-tenant platform, not a single-team
  sandbox.
- The product target is also a user-facing enterprise platform where the web
  console is expected to support visual agent orchestration, evaluation,
  publishing, and release management.
- `Tenant` and `Workspace` currently exist as CRD-backed runtime-scope bridge
  resources. Do not extend them into the canonical enterprise tenant/workspace
  product database.
- `Workspace` now has a lightweight lifecycle: it resolves `tenantRef`,
  publishes a console scope endpoint, and records its effective namespace.
- `Tenant` now records an aggregated `workspaceCount` in status.
- `Agent` and `AgentEvaluation` can now declare `workspaceRef`; controllers
  already validate those references against Ready workspaces before proceeding.
- `Workspace.spec.policyRef` can provide the default `AgentPolicy` for agents
  that do not set `Agent.spec.policyRef`, and
  `Workspace.spec.providerPolicy.allowedProviders` is enforced before agent
  compilation.
- `Workspace.spec.providerPolicy.bindings` can provide provider-level defaults
  such as `baseURL` and Secret-backed `credentialRef`; inherit references only,
  never secret values.
- Evaluation should grow into a flagship capability, not remain an auxiliary
  CRD.
- `AgentEvaluation` is moving toward a first-class enterprise contract with
  typed dataset, baseline, evaluator, threshold gate, and reporting fields.
- `AgentEvaluation` can now evaluate both a current agent and an optional
  baseline agent, then publish score deltas and gate deltas into status;
  extend that comparison path rather than creating a second revision-compare
  mechanism.
- `Dataset` is the reusable evaluation sample surface; prefer referencing it
  from `AgentEvaluation.datasetRef` over embedding large sample sets directly
  into runtime config.
- `Dataset.spec.samples[].expected` is the first-class rule-eval surface for
  simple metrics such as exact field matches and count checks; extend that
  before adding a parallel evaluation DSL.
- Structured evaluators should layer on top of the same `Dataset.expected`
  surface. Current examples are `risk_level_match` and `hazard_coverage`.
- `AgentEvaluation` can already create a managed `AgentRun` from
  `spec.runtime.sampleInput` or `spec.runtime.samples` and fold aggregated
  run/gate status back into its own status; extend that path instead of
  inventing a parallel evaluation engine.
- `AgentRun` now carries workspace identity in status. Gateway-created runs
  inherit it from the target `Agent`, and evaluation-managed runs inherit it
  from `AgentEvaluation.spec.workspaceRef`.
- The future manager should own product tenants, workspaces, users, teams,
  memberships, releases, durable audits, and UI drafts in a database, while the
  operator remains usable without the manager.
- Model provider support should evolve into a capability matrix that treats
  Chinese domestic providers as first-class targets.
- `ModelSpec.provider` is no longer just a free-form string in practice: the
  compiler validates it against the provider catalog, emits provider family
  metadata into artifacts, and the worker currently routes the
  `openai-compatible` family through the existing chat-model path.
- `Skill` can currently contribute prompts, tools, knowledge, functions, and
  graph fragments.
- `react` can expand into a runner graph when `spec.graph` is empty.
- ReAct expansion should consume normal agent-selected knowledge and tools.
- Worker execution currently supports model, tool, retrieval, function, and
  step-based graph execution in a staged form.
- OrbStack local Kubernetes smoke validation is part of the intended developer
  workflow.

## Required Workflow For Code Changes

If you change API types:

1. update `api/v1alpha1/...`
2. run `make generate manifests`
3. verify generated files changed as expected

If you change compiler, runtime, or worker behavior:

1. update focused tests first or alongside the change
2. run at least the affected package tests
3. run `make test` before finishing
4. consider whether the change affects tenancy, evaluation, provider support,
   visual orchestration semantics, or future UI semantics; if so, update the
   relevant docs

If you change samples or local validation behavior:

1. keep `config/samples/ehs` as the canonical sample source
2. keep `config/samples/ehs-orbstack-smoke` aligned with the local smoke path
3. prefer `kustomize`-based sample application

## Commands You Should Actually Use

Use these commands by default:

```bash
make test
make generate manifests
make build
make k8s-smoke-ehs
```

Useful targeted commands:

```bash
go test ./internal/compiler/...
go test ./internal/worker/...
go test ./internal/runtime/...
```

## Local Validation Expectations

Before concluding substantial runtime or compiler work:

- run `make test`
- run `git diff --check`

For changes affecting worker execution, runtime dispatch, or EHS samples, also
prefer validating with local Kubernetes when available:

```bash
make k8s-smoke-ehs
```

## Anti-Patterns To Avoid

Do not:

- add secret values to status, artifacts, logs, or compiled artifacts
- bypass `Secret` references by inlining credentials into specs
- hand-edit generated deepcopy or CRD files without regenerating from source
- introduce major product concepts without a typed API and compiler story
- add speculative frameworks that are not on the current roadmap
- split samples across duplicate directories

## Documentation Expectations

When behavior changes materially, update the relevant docs:

- `README.md`
- `README.zh-CN.md`
- `docs/architecture/component-boundaries.md`
- `docs/architecture/manager-data-model.md`
- `docs/architecture/manager-operator-sync.md`
- `docs/phase2/eino-runtime-design.md`
- `docs/phase2/agent-patterns-and-a2a-todo.md`
- `docs/phase3/console-information-architecture.md`
- `docs/phase3/tenancy-workspace-model.md`

When the change affects enterprise product direction, also keep these topics
current in docs and code comments where appropriate:

- multi-tenant and workspace boundaries
- evaluation-first product semantics
- provider capability matrix and domestic provider support
- UX implications for the future web console

Keep docs aligned with current truth. Do not leave roadmap tables claiming
"Not started" when code already exists.

## When In Doubt

If a change could go in multiple directions, prefer the option that:

- extends the existing CRD/compiler/runtime pipeline
- preserves deterministic compiled artifacts
- keeps runtime semantics explicit
- helps future `SubAgent` and A2A work instead of creating a parallel model

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for issue tracking and [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) (`bv`) for graph-aware triage. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). Instead of parsing JSONL or hallucinating graph traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, k-core).

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). `br` handles creating, modifying, and closing beads.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY --robot-* flags. Bare bv launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

#### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns everything you need in one call:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command

# Token-optimized output (TOON) for lower LLM context usage:
bv --robot-triage --format toon
```

#### Other bv Commands

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with unblocks lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions, cycle breaks |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |

#### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work (no blockers)
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank scores
```

### br Commands for Issue Management

```bash
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason="Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export DB to JSONL
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Triage**: Run `bv --robot-triage` to find the highest-impact actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `br sync --flush-only` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers 0-4, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads changes to JSONL
git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything
git push                # Push to remote
```
